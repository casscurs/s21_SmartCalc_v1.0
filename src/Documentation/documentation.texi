The application is written using QT Creator.

In this project, an extended version of a conventional calculator is
implemented in the C programming language using a structural approach,
which can be found in standard applications of each operating system. In
addition to basic arithmetic operations like plus-minus and
multiply-divide, we have supplemented the calculator with the ability to
calculate arithmetic expressions taking into account priorities, as well
as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). In
addition to calculating expressions, the calculator must also support
the use of the variable x and plotting the corresponding function. As
additional improvements, it will be possible to consider a loan and
deposit calculator.

To switch to the graphics mode, press the ``Graphics'' button.

To use the special modes ``Deposit Calculator'' and ``Loan Calculator'',
it is necessary to use the upper mode switching panel.
